“Good morning everyone.
We are presenting our project — ‘Automatic denial system for vehicle .’
This project helps stop unauthorized vehicles automatically using sensors and a servo motor.

The components we have used are:

Arduino Uno – It is the brain of our project.

Two Ultrasonic Sensors – One detects objects at 20 cm distance and the other at 15 cm.

One Servo Motor – It lifts and lowers the road barrier.

A Buzzer – It gives siren sound in case of an emergency.

orange, Red and Blue LEDs – They flash like a police siren when an enemy vehicle is detected.

A Colorful LED – It glows when the system is ON and everything is safe.

A Switch – To turn the system ON or OFF.

Jumper Wires, Breadboard, and a 9V Battery for power and connections.

All of these components are connected to the Arduino Uno on a cardboard base.”

“Now, let me explain the working of our project.

When the switch is turned ON and no object is in front of the sensors, the colorful LED glows showing that the system is ready.

When Sensor 1 detects an object within 20 centimeters, the servo motor moves 45 degrees, lifting the thermocol road slightly.
At the same time, the orange LED and buzzer turn ON for 8 seconds.
This shows that a vehicle is approaching the army gate.

If the vehicle or enemy comes even closer, within 15 centimeters, Sensor 2 gets activated.
Then the servo moves 70 degrees, lifting the road higher to stop the vehicle.
The red and blue LEDs flash alternately like a police siren, and the buzzer makes an emergency sound.

After 8 seconds, if no new object is detected, everything turns OFF automatically, and the road comes back down.”

“Now let’s talk about the mechanical setup and real-life use.

We made the road using thermocol, attached to the servo motor horn using glue.
The servo is fixed on one side of the base, and when it rotates, it lifts the thermocol road just like a real gate.
At 45 degrees, it slightly lifts for checking, and at 70 degrees, it completely blocks the way.

This project can be very useful in army camps, toll gates, and security checkpoints, because it automatically detects any approaching vehicle and stops it if needed — without human effort.

It also adds safety since the buzzer and flashing lights give a warning signal to the soldiers.

Thank you!” all together
